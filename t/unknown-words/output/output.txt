<details><summary>To accept these unrecognized words as correct and remove the previously acknowledged and now absent words,
you could run the following commands</summary>

... in a clone of the [GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME](GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME) repository
([:information_source: how do I use this?](
https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Accepting-Suggestions)):

``` sh

git commit -m 'Update check-spelling metadata'
```
</details>

<details><summary>Available :books: dictionaries could cover words (expected and unrecognized) not in the :blue_book: dictionary</summary>

This includes both **expected items** (2) from WORKSPACE/t/unknown-words/config/expect.txt and **unrecognized words** (6)

Dictionary | Entries | Covers | Uniquely
-|-|-|-
[extra:elvish.txt](EXTRA_DICTIONARIES_PROTO/elvish.txt)|6|2|2|

Consider creating a workflow (e.g. from GITHUB_SERVER_URL/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml`)) and adding them:
``` yml
        with:
          extra_dictionaries: |
            extra:elvish.txt
```

To stop checking additional dictionaries, add:
``` yml
check_extra_dictionaries: ""
```

</details>
<details><summary>Forbidden patterns :no_good: (1)</summary>

In order to address this, you could change the content to not match the forbidden patterns (comments before forbidden patterns may help explain why they're forbidden), add patterns for acceptable instances, or adjust the forbidden patterns themselves.

These forbidden patterns matched content:

#### Should be `sample-file.txt`
```
\bsample\.file\b
```

</details>

<details><summary>Errors and Warnings :x: (3)</summary>

#### See the [:scroll:action log](GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME/actions/runs/GITHUB_RUN_ID) or :memo: job summary for details.
